JUMP GOALS:

+ stage
- commit
- pull
- push
- replace pull-push with a single merge or pull button when push is impossible
- remove repo from sources list


Newbie-oriented features:
+ bundled git binaries
- SSH_ASKPASS for interacting with ssh
- bonjour repo sharing
- conflict state representation



0.9.8:
- show in about box or in preferences a message how to obtain git source
- allow switching to a system-provided git in preferences



Top priority:
- payment thing
- nice screenshots
- simpler definition and wording
- welcome screen
- clone repo
- bonjour publishing and cloning (see http://github.com/chad/gitjour)
- github integration: handling other repos/branches, pull requests and initial setup commands

Sources:
- delete key
- context menu to delete item
- reorder repos


Bugs:
- maybe a bug: if the stage view is not selected, commit: action is not available
- bug: when adding files to stage too quickly, git-add fails on .git/index.lock (should put all index modifying operations in a single serial dispatch queue)
- fsevents: reset a notification delay when receiving update to the same path again (usefull if some long process keeps updating disk: like git-checkout)
- bug: table row selection is ignored if was no selection for ArrayController. Should check NSTableView selectedRowIndexes? See http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=166469 
- bug: for non-existent HEAD gitbox does not show a staged new file
- bug: show disabled "No branches" item for inaccessible remote
- bug: repository stage/branch updating tasks are stuck in activity window with running status
- bug: historical diff for Added file shows diff between current state (left) and initial state (right)


UI glitches:
- remember activity window visibility

UI features:
- human message in case git cannot merge/pull when some files are modified (error: Untracked working tree file 'Patryst.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj' would be overwritten by merge.)


Easy features:
- DONE, SHOULD TEST: pull should merge fetched commits, but perform the pull immediately afterwards
- force push a branch
- create a new tag
- stash list: as a local branch menu item?
- stash/apply stash from the menu, context menu
- quicklook for the file on space in stage


Hard features:
- do ls-remote in background starting on unfocus (or not only in background)

- find/nav bar sliding down in the history:
  - filters commits by sha-1, modified filenames and text
  - back/forward buttons allow undo/redo commit selection (clicking on parents)
- maybe: easy/hidden rebase to keep history clean? (actually, need a "rebase continue" and "cancel")
- 'git svn rebase' and 'git svn dcommit'
- clone a repo from the gui (menu item)
- amend latest commit if it is not pushed yet
- find-as-you-type search in stage
- shell command to open gitbox
- history: probably get rid of dates, and design it in a more cheesy fashion
- history: navigate to the sha1
- history: navigate back and forward (History main menu)
- history: checkout a commit
- history: check out a branch from the commit item
- history: add "load more" cell in the bottom of the log
- commit header: show parent ids using <a href="gitbox://git@sss.pierlis.com/repo.git#commits/sha1">...</a>
- handling URL schema: gitbox://git@sss.pierlis.com/repo.git#commits/sha1
- fetch in background should reset fetch interval when new commits are fetched
- gitosis integration
- submodules UI
- conflict stage: highlight conflicted changes, allow to choose one of the versions 
- individual chunks commit
- show branch/tag names in history using "label" (+color in green/blue to connect with green/blue "pills")

Other:
- hitting space bar for staging/unstaging a change
- browse the server with SSH and select a repository
- log: mark as read/unread + automatic mark as read
- compare office files using some office app: cooperate with Kaleidoscope
- compare image files in an double-pane image viewer
- built-in diff view for better UTF8 support (FileMerge is stupid)


UILab nonsense:
- fatter arrows
- labels from arrows to the bottom of the item
- bottom bar for stage
- choose font for commits 

Bonjour info:
- publish and locate service with NSNetService API
- see gitjour ruby script and try to use it to test client


Done:
+ bug: commit button should be enabled only when the stage is not clean or there is a selection in the tableview
+ release notes window
+ nice scrollbar and commit cell selection
+ bug: preferences toolbar has no selected item
+ bug: diff tool radio group has no selected item
+ bug: should prefer branch connection in the .git/config (and .git/gitbox.plist as a backup)
+ bug: preferences window shows "error: file not found" on fresh setup
+ redraw scrollbar to appear over the history table with half-opacity
+ bundle git binaries with the app package
+ sidebar: cmd+shift+[] to switch between repos
+ change window title when repo is switched
+ bug: when selecting commit, the cell is not updated immediately
+ bug: when selected a repo, stage is half-updated + stale content from the previous repo
+ bug: very annoying selection loose on stage/unstage
+ bug: sometimes spinner does not stop spinning or toolbar items are just disabled - maybe bindings problem
+ bug: disable status table view while status is updating (double click on a stale row crashes the app)
+ remotes controller: select current remote in the list
+ glitch: sometimes fake modification of xcodeproj appears in the stage due to async git-status call (it is a case for quick switching from xcode to gitbox right after it synced)
+ fsevents: should refresh status on FSEvent directory change (in background)
+ fsevents: reread remotes on focus: if the names and urls are the same, do not ls-remote
+ sidebar to group repositories
+ bug: should try running NSTasks blocking in a background to work around the leaks (should be fixed with GCD)
+ disable toolbar editing


0.9.7:
+ pull with already present fetched commits should just merge, not fetch again
+ single "S" shortcut for stage/unstage
+ tooltip for commit cell to show the unmerged/unpushed status
+ (null) in .gitignore (perhaps the same selection issue)
+ KVO crash fixes
+ Kaleidoscope.app integration
+ clean up remote branches menu
+ commit prompt: cmd+up/down to scroll through the recent messages

0.9.6:
+ gitignore: ignore context menu item in the stage

0.9.5:
+ local branch merge
+ handle package (.bundle) - see email
+ bug: do not resolve symbolic links when choosing a path: can change that in prefs
+ case: when people have multiple installations, one can be outdated and they don't even know about it (prefs for git path)
+ performance: group common changes for a single commit command
+ normal size toolbar controls

0.9.2:
+ bug: crash on window close: unbind on window closing
+ bug: after the window is closed, the repository is still updating in background
+ bug: in some cases after pull or stage command repository cannot be deallocated and its controller as well
+ bug: a new repo remote branch menu is just empty: need a "add repo" item
+ handle new repo: push to a new master branch
+ handle pushing to a new branch: allow branch creation in "remote branch" dropdown
+ bug: for new remote branch rev-list shows an error, thus making history empty

0.9.1:
+ bug: "Some Default Text" in the prompt
+ alert if git version is lower than 1.7.1

0.9:
+ create a new repo from the gui (by dropping a non-git folder)

0.8:
+ unmerged/unpushed commits
+ ask for binary
+ multiline commit window
+ NSViewController for GBRepositoryWindow
+ remembering remote-local association
+ should increase fetch interval in background to alleviate NSTask leaks
+ commit changes do not display renames properly
+ switch context menu for historical commits
+ empty filenames for untracked folder
+ do not open another window for the same repo if already opened, just make it a key window
+ when opened git.git repo spinner spins forever
+ git diff-tree returns top-level folders instead of full paths (use -r)
+ when fetching in background log shrinks (have no idea what happens)
+ "OATask failed: opendiff" - it is twice, is it because of terminating it?
+ local branch change does not refresh log
+ remote branch checkout does not update remote branch menu
+ sometimes hangs when FileMerge is opened (for a couple of seconds): http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?WrappingUnixApps

Strange things:

- if a lazy accessor is bound, there can be infinite loop on setter call; perhaps should not use setter within a getter


Not to do:

- git blame: rare function, needs specific file listing UI; make another app;


Useful commands:

- list of SHA1 commit ids: git rev-list --format=raw --max-count=500 --skip=0 HEAD
- changes within a commit: git diff-tree df586737bc78d556b1ee5cfc567bbdee74b627b8 -r -m --no-commit-id
- changes on the stage: git diff-index --cached --ignore-submodules -z HEAD
- changes on the working directory (not including staged): git diff-files --ignore-submodules -z
- untracked files: git ls-files --other --exclude-standard -z

$ man git-diff-tree:

       git-diff-index <tree-ish>
           compares the <tree-ish> and the files on the filesystem.

       git-diff-index --cached <tree-ish>
           compares the <tree-ish> and the index.

       git-diff-tree [-r] <tree-ish-1> <tree-ish-2> [<pattern>...]
           compares the trees named by the two arguments.

       git-diff-files [<pattern>...]
           compares the index and the files on the filesystem.
