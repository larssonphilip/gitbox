Showstoppers:

- clone repo
- welcome screen
- payment thing
- nice screenshots
- simpler definition and wording


Ongoing tasks:

- the rest of helper windows
- Secondary windows are opened in sheets (Preferences, Open Repository etc.)
- restore message history in commit prompt (cmd+up; cmd+down)
- check that opendiff is selected by default on new start + it is not selected if it is missing
- GIT_ASKPASS/SSH_ASKPASS for interacting with ssh
- human message in case git cannot merge/pull when some files are modified (error: Untracked working tree file 'Patryst.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj' would be overwritten by merge.)
- a block-based method for GBRepository to temporarily remember current error (name, description) for the use in the UI
- create a new tag
- check for memory leaks
- sidebar context menu: show in finder, open in terminal
+ sidebar: sort by two components, but display two components for every repo in a folder if one of them is long


Bugs:


- maybe a bug: if the stage view is not selected, commit: action is not available
- bug: when adding files to stage too quickly, git-add fails on .git/index.lock (should put all index modifying operations in a single serial dispatch queue)
- bug: for non-existent HEAD gitbox does not show a staged new file
- bug: show disabled "No branches" item for inaccessible remote
- bug: repository stage/branch updating tasks are stuck in activity window with running status
- bug: historical diff for Added file shows diff between current state (left) and initial state (right)
+ bug: do not run ANY change-related operations if the change is busy (causes crashes sometimes)
+ bug: revert and delete command when invoked with a right-click loose selection because of the prompt window. Should use block API for prompt and remember selected items immediately.
+ commit text field is cleared when focused (fixes old bug with full text selection)

Cool features:

- conflict state representation
- bonjour publishing and cloning (see http://github.com/chad/gitjour; NSNetService)
- github integration: handling other repos/branches, pull requests and initial setup commands
- fetch periodically
- do ls-remote in background starting on unfocus (or not only in background)
- force push a branch
- stash list: as a local branch menu item?
- stash/apply stash from the menu, context menu
- quicklook for the file on space in stage
- drop folder to source list
- user-sortable list of repositories
- drag GBChange to open in application or copy to finder
- gitosis integration
- find/nav bar sliding down in the history:
  - filters commits by sha-1, modified filenames and text
  - back/forward buttons allow undo/redo commit selection (clicking on parents)
- maybe: easy/hidden rebase to keep history clean? (actually, need a "rebase continue" and "cancel")
- amend latest commit if it is not pushed yet
- find-as-you-type search in stage
- shell command to open gitbox
- history: probably get rid of dates, and design it in a more cheesy fashion
- history: navigate to the sha1
- history: navigate back and forward (History main menu)
- history: checkout a commit
- history: check out a branch from the commit item
- history: add "load more" cell in the bottom of the log
- commit header: show parent ids using <a href="gitbox://git@sss.pierlis.com/repo.git#commits/sha1">...</a>
- handling URL schema: gitbox://git@sss.pierlis.com/repo.git#commits/sha1
- fetch in background should reset fetch interval when new commits are fetched
- submodules UI
- conflict stage: highlight conflicted changes, allow to choose one of the versions 
- individual chunks commit
- show branch/tag names in history using "label" (+color in green/blue to connect with green/blue "pills")


Enhancements (works fine, but can be better):

- remember activity window visibility
- fetch menu item
- fetch holding alt
- when starting a gitbox should configure user's name and email if missing
- hitting space bar for staging/unstaging a change


Something to think about:

- allow switching to a system-provided git in preferences
- browse the server with SSH and select a repository
- log: mark as read/unread + automatic mark as read
- compare office files using some office app: cooperate with Kaleidoscope
- compare image files in an double-pane image viewer
- built-in diff view for better UTF8 support (FileMerge is stupid)
- mercurial support
- svn support ('git svn rebase' and 'git svn dcommit')
- csv support

Strange things:

- if a lazy accessor is bound, there can be infinite loop on setter call; perhaps should not use setter within a getter

Not to do:

- git blame: rare function, needs specific file listing UI; make another app;


Useful commands:

- list of SHA1 commit ids: git rev-list --format=raw --max-count=500 --skip=0 HEAD
- changes within a commit: git diff-tree df586737bc78d556b1ee5cfc567bbdee74b627b8 -r -m --no-commit-id
- changes on the stage: git diff-index --cached --ignore-submodules -z HEAD
- changes on the working directory (not including staged): git diff-files --ignore-submodules -z
- untracked files: git ls-files --other --exclude-standard -z

$ man git-diff-tree:

       git-diff-index <tree-ish>
           compares the <tree-ish> and the files on the filesystem.

       git-diff-index --cached <tree-ish>
           compares the <tree-ish> and the index.

       git-diff-tree [-r] <tree-ish-1> <tree-ish-2> [<pattern>...]
           compares the trees named by the two arguments.

       git-diff-files [<pattern>...]
           compares the index and the files on the filesystem.
