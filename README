1.1:

- drag and drop for sources (see the SourceView sample code for handling the drag and drop)
- drag and drop for changes
- find in commits
- quicklook in changes
- badges for sidebar
- tag and branch badges in history
- create a new tag (need a tag badge)


To read:
- read carefully: https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitSurvey2010
- reactions to macappstore: http://www.tuaw.com/2010/10/21/developer-reactions-to-the-mac-app-store/#continued


Ongoing tasks:

- do ls-remote in background starting on unfocus (or not only in background)
- read ls-remotes when updated .git
- human message in case git cannot merge/pull when some files are modified (error: Untracked working tree file 'Patryst.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj' would be overwritten by merge.)
- a block-based method for GBRepository to temporarily remember current error (name, description) for the use in the UI
- GIT_ASKPASS/SSH_ASKPASS for interacting with ssh
- Secondary windows are opened in sheets (Preferences, Open Repository etc.)
- check for memory leaks
- check behavior when opendiff is missing
- check that opendiff is selected by default on new start + it is not selected if it is missing
+ make preferences a single view with all options


Bugs:

- bug: when ssh server is not added to known_hosts, gitbox fails parsing the output
- bug: when deselected all repos, the changes view remains visible
- when a long process modifies the working directory, the FSEvents wait till the very end, but should refresh each 2 seconds or so.
- bug: bare repository is not recognized as such: should provide read-only access
- maybe a bug: if the stage view is not selected, commit: action is not available
- preferences: should select "Other" when typing
- preferences: should focus text field when selected "Other"
- todo: think on the best and consistent way to terminate tasks
- delete a repo from the list by pressing backspace
- bug: terminal window opens behind the gitbox window (see http://www.wmdeveloper.com/2010/09/open-terminal-here.html)


Cool features:

- undo for commit (like amend)
- undo for pull
- undo for ref checkout
- undo for branch reset
- conflict stage: highlight conflicted changes, allow to choose one of the versions 
- delete local branch
- delete remote branch
- force push a branch (when push fails, allow force push)
- quicklook for the file on space in stage (QLPreviewPanel, sample code: QuickLookDownloader)
- bonjour publishing and cloning (see http://github.com/chad/gitjour; NSNetService)
- github integration: handling other repos/branches, pull requests and initial setup commands
- show number of pending changes in the sidebar (like in Mail.app)
- drop a folder to the source list
- user-sortable list of repositories
- drag GBChange to open in application or copy to finder
- find/nav bar sliding down in the history:
  - filters commits by sha-1, modified filenames and text
  - back/forward buttons allow undo/redo commit selection (clicking on parents)
- maybe: easy/hidden rebase to keep history clean? (actually, need a "rebase continue" and "cancel")
- amend latest commit if it is not pushed yet
- find-as-you-type search in stage
- history: probably get rid of dates, and design it in a more cheesy fashion
- history: navigate to the sha1
- history: navigate back and forward (History main menu)
- history: reset a branch to a selected commit
- history: checkout a commit
- history: extract commit into new folder
- history: check out a branch from the commit item
- history: add "load more" cell in the bottom of the log
- show branch/tag names in history using "label" (+color in green/blue to connect with green/blue "pills")
- gitosis integration
- shell command to open gitbox
- stash list: as a local branch menu item?
- stash/apply stash from the menu, context menu
- commit header: show parent ids using <a href="gitbox://git@sss.pierlis.com/repo.git#commits/sha1">...</a>
- handling URL schema: gitbox://git@sss.pierlis.com/repo.git#commits/sha1
- submodules UI
- individual chunks commit
- diff viewer: file history, diff and blame in one window
- diff viewer: load blame info & history asynchronously
- diff viewer: switch to hide history
- diff viewer: button to go to a folder at this commit 
- changes view: 2 tabs: changes & tree (tree should show a status as usual)
- Option/Alt key lets to fetch instead of pull
- Shift key lets force push


Enhancements (works fine, but can be better):

- nice screen for the commit: bigger line height, variable height message, no awful table header, segmented switch for sorting
- gravatar image in the commit window
- snap sidebar
- do not resize sidebar when resizing a window
- do not load stuff for the commit immediately while scrolling - have a delay
- remember activity window visibility
- hitting space bar for staging/unstaging a change


Something to think about:

- allow switching to a system-provided git in preferences
- browse the server with SSH and select a repository
- log: mark as read/unread + automatic mark as read
- compare office files using some office app: cooperate with Kaleidoscope
- compare image files in an double-pane image viewer
- built-in diff view for better UTF8 support (FileMerge is stupid)
- mercurial support
- svn support ('git svn rebase' and 'git svn dcommit')
- csv support
