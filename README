To do:

- prompt for a name when checking out a new branch
- check out a branch from the remote one
- check out a branch from the commit item
- change "sync" button title to "push" when remote is not ahead of local branch
- change "sync" button title to "pull" when remote is ahead of local branch
- change "sync" button title to "merge" when remote is local
- change "remote branch" label to "other branch" when remote is local
- fetch current remote branch every minute
- open a window per repo
- remember tracking in .git/config when switching a remote branch
- left pane: log for current local branch
- add "stage" cell in the top of the log - shows stage and working directory status
- add "load more" cell in the bottom of the log
- right pane: changes (files)
- handle new repo: push to a new master branch
- handle pushing to a new branch: allow branch creation in "remote branch" dropdown
- switch off 1min sync with a toolbar button: useful on battery
- clone a repo from the gui (menu item)
- create a new repo from the gui (by dropping a non-git folder)

- stash/apply stash from the menu, context menu

- maybe: easy/hidden rebase to keep history clean?


Not to do:

- toolbar item for stash/unstash: rare function;
- git blame: rare function, needs specific file listing UI; make another app;
