Github integration

Iteration 1:

- should display accessible repos, but there could be many of them - need filter or quick search and maybe folders also.
- each repo should browse branches and commits
- "clone..." button in the toolbar to immediately clone the repo

Iteration 2:

- full github browser: by user name, by repos name
- watched repositories

Iteration 3:

- pull requests

Iteration 4:

- organizations and teams
