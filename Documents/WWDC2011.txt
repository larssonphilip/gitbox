Questions for WWDC 2011:

- Looks like when the flag is missing kFSEventStreamCreateFlagNoDefer, stream still does not defer events?
- How to implement cmd+click in tableview-hosted checkboxes? Cannot receive events in checkbox cell.
- Why Xcode4 sometimes consumes 100-200% CPU on Macbook Air?
- FSEvents: how to design in such a way so no to miss events and support sequential updates?
- [NSApp postEvent:] as a workaround for retained pipes/fds after [NSTask waitUntilExit] in the secondary thread.
- AppleScript interaction (send data, get data)
- LLDB fucks up output from NSTasks.
- How to organize menus. Especially when they are duplicated in main menu, contextual menu and toolbar.
- LLVM Clang produces funny segfault issues (self is invalid pointer in the block)
