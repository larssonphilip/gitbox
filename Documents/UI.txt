- Q: How to present and checkout buttons? 
  - badge "Current"
  - on selected branch - button "Checkout"
    - need to prevent click on a checkout button if just wanted to select row
- Q: How to present the branch list?
  - option 1: like in Xcode - with an extra bar and small tabs to switch between repos and selected repo's branch (but this goes against hierarchy)
  - option 2: expansion button in the bottom bar, under history
