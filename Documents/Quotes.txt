And by God, I’ve been waiting for an app like this for ages.

Gitbox — Git version control on the Mac - Now this is just sexy, why must Mac users mock me like this?

@mickael
Trying Gitbox 1.0. Will it save my soul and sanity ?

@ejeklint
Just bought Gitbox. Missed the coupon and 30% off due to trigger happy fingers, but what the heck, @oleganza is worth a tip. :)

@olivierlacan 
A great license model by @oleganza for his new Gitbox 1.0. http://blog.oleganza.com/post//gitbox-1-0-released

@FGRibreau
Gitbox rocks my world!

@jpcody
Nice Dribbble find! Been using Gitbox, @gitboxupdates. It's nice, and it's Cocoa.

@sustainableweb
I finally found a good looking Git GUI App (source code control for mac) http://gitbox.pierlis.com/ @gitboxupdates thanks!

@mdo @cloudhead Version control outside the Terminal is usually a clusterfuck. Gitbox looks the most straightforward that I've seen thus far.
