Diff View is a mode in the main window.

When user double-clicks the file:
- sidebar and history collapse to the left, 
- file list slides to the left and becomes smaller,
- big diff view appears on the right (as a 4th panel)
- toolbar is replaced by diff-related buttons:
  - "back" button to get to the normal view
  - "diff | blame" switch

OBSOLETE: Diff and Blame




When user hits space or double clicks the changed file, QuickLook-like panel appears.

We have 3 modes: 
- for text files - our diff/blame panel
- for image files - our image diff panel
- for other files - regular quicklook panel for the modified version

0. Should fix the behaviour of the shared quicklook panel: so that when different commit/change is selected, the QL panel is updated properly.

1. Text Diff/Blame panel:

- black translucent window with 3 buttons: "Diff", "Blame" icons in the middle and text-button "File History" on the right.
- diff and blame switch the content
- when "File History" clicked: commits list is scrolled to the top and search bar gets file name inserted. Current commit and file are still selected. Need a short animation of the window opacity: 100% -> 50% -> 100% to show that history is updated.
- when selecting different commits in history, should maintain the file selection and update floating panel accordingly.
- diff/blame option should be remembered.

1.1. Textual Diff:

- light blue diff with bezier-curve transition (FileMerge-like)
- line numbers
- left pane is slighly smaller by default so that right pane is bigger (newer stuff is more interesting + files grow)
- idea: for multiple selected files concatenate diffs - useful when pieces of code where transferred across files

1.2. Blame view:

- light-gray sidebar with adjustable width
- adaptive text layout in the sidebar: only name and the date. Show time if has space, show only name when tight.
- do not show images - distracting
- show the name once for a chunk of the same-commit changes, but keep it visible like table sections on iphone
- tooltip for a line: show commit sha1 and message.
- when clicked on a name, jump to that commit. 
  - Do not jump if it is already selected. 
  - While jumping do 100%->50%->100% alpha animation for panel
- for current commit use gray color + button "up" to jump to the parent commit

  
2. Image Diff:

- 2 modes: side-by-side and optional vertical splitter for the same-sized images
- zoom control
- background change: checkerboard, gray, white, black
