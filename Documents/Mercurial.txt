Mercurial

Wouldn't it be great if you could use Gitbox with Mercurial repos?

IMPORTANT: do only after git-svn support, because it will already reveal some conceptual issues and let us refactor the code.

We have two options:

1. Native support
2. Git->Hg adapter (similar to Git->SVN)

I'm not sure how much modifications would it take to abstract away all git-specific methods. 

Second option is to use adapter https://github.com/offbytwo/git-hg

But adapter will still require some refactoring and code abstraction. Maybe it's better to go all native in the long run.
