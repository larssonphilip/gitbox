FSEvents

Problems:

1. Need simple reliable NSObject wrapper for FSEventStream API
2. When Gitbox reacts to the changes on filesystem, it can trigger fs event.
   Normally, such event should make Gitbox perform UI update.
   There's a special case, however: when Gitbox performs stage update, it calls refresh-index which updates .git/index file.
   In this case update inside .git folder should be ignored.

To address the first problem we'll have OAFSEventStream class. 
And to address various git-specific issues we'll have GBFolderMonitor
with event silencing, path filtering and coalescing.

Each repository should have it's own GBFolderMonitor listening to both ./ and .git/ folders.
Each monitor should share a single instance of OAFSEventStream class to avoid duplication of file descriptors.
