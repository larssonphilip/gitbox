Authentication

You can connect to git repos using different methods:

  git          - tested
  git+ssh      - tested, password requests are handled by askpass.rb 
  http, https  - auth uses SSH_ASKPASS
  rsync        - not tested
  
SSH authentication:

  - Question "add to known hosts? yes/no" is handled by askpass.rb script.
  - Passphrase-protected SSH keys are intercepted by Mac OS X dialog completely.
  - Regular SSH password is gathered using askpass.rb script.
  
  Major bug: in 1.1 password was remembered in Keychain immediately and then used automatically. 
             When password becomes invalid, Gitbox does not invalidate it and does not let you enter it again.
             
             Full fix: detect that the password was not accepted (can test for any error) and next time ask for it.

Remembered passwords and user names should be available in the settings and asked only once.

HTTP authentication:

  Needs thorough testing. Right now Basic Auth login/password dialog is not supported at all!
