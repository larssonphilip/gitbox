-----------------------------------------------------------

1.2 WIP:

+ submodules: init after clone or pull to add .gitmodules info to .git/config
- submodules: case 1: user clones a repo which has some submodules => needs init, display "download" button for submodules in sidebar
- submodules: case 2: user pulls a repo which has some submodules updated => needs pull
- submodules: case 3: user pulls a repo which has some submodules updated, but his submodule itself is checked out on some branch => needs fetch, not pull
- submodules: case 4: user clones the repo inside the repo => needs to display as a non-tracked submodule which can be tracked
- submodules: case 5: user tries to commit a submodule which has the HEAD non-pushed (or dirty directory) - show warning or ask to push manually; show button "show module"

- sidebar: refactor to GBSidebarItem
- sidebar: fallback to the list of local repos from user defaults
- sidebar: add a new group with default name to the end
- sidebar: drag and drop groups
- sidebar: special case - if dragged several repos from the same folder, and there's no group with the same name as their folder, wrap them all in a new group automatically.
- sidebar: remove a group with backspace
- sidebar: distinct menu for the group: remove and rename
- sidebar: revisit the code which checks the license and number of repos
  
- quicklook for changes

Bugs:

- bug: multi-line commit messages are not displayed correctly [ticket 973]
- bug: in the right branch menu should display the current local branch, but disable it (currently it is not displayed at all)
- bug: autofetch sometimes does not work: maybe some crap is returned from ls-remote when communicating with a remote server; test with berger; seems like it stops working after some time or after gitbox restart. Also check that performSelector:withObject:afterDelay does not fail for big values.
- bug: sometimes some duplicate branch name appears in popdown menus
- bug: when selected all changes and hit "revert", one change is not reverted; same thing for a single change also
- bug: when pushing and switching branches, gitbox tries to fetch immediately which blocks the interaction. Should add a delay to perform fetch only after user is done doing what he was doing
- bug: should stage selected changes when hit "Commit message..." box [ticket 974]
- bug: after cmd+W (while app is still in foreground), clicking on dock icon does not bring window back.
- bug: check that in appstore build there is a help message in the bottom of preferences panel. [Markus Fritze <my@sarnau.com>]
- bug: when password changed after being remembered in keychain access, gitbox fails to authenticate. [Scott Snibbe <scott@snibbe.com>]
- bug: while fetching some remote, commits list is refreshed with wrong commits
- bug: bare repository is not recognized as such: should provide read-only access
- bug: when removing a single server, remote branch remains and log is clean
- bug: when clicked checkbox and want to drag out, it does not undo the action.
- bug: when switching the branch or pulling/pushing, the list of commits flashes: should add a delay before reloading the commits
- bug: android repo checked out on a commit has branch menus disabled.
- bug: when /Developer is symlinked to another partition, opendiff cannot launch FileMerge: "exception raised trying to run FileMerge: launch path not accessible" [Jeff Snell <jeffsnell@mac.com>]
- bug: cannot commit a file with space in the path or something [Matthew Temple <matt@mattytemple.com>]
- bug: sidebar: when collapsing a group, spinners remain spinning indefinitely


Enhancements:

- show confirmation prompt when trying to push branch "X" into "origin/Y" (that is when branch name differ)
- feature: checkout a commit from history context menu
- should remove image view and resize header view if not image is present
- should display a branch hint if the different branch is selected (commit text field)

- allow 3 repos for free so ppl who don't want to pay just now may start actually using without searching for keygen?
- find in commits
- find/nav bar sliding down in the history:
  - filters commits by sha-1, modified filenames and text
  - back/forward buttons allow undo/redo commit selection (clicking on parents)
- quicklook for the file on space in stage (QLPreviewPanel, sample code: QuickLookDownloader)


Done for 1.2:

+ bug: should change "araxis" for "compare"
+ toolbar alignment
+ [+] button for adding a repo
+ sidebar: add spinners to each item (like in Mail.app)
+ linkify emails in commit header
+ disable push button if nothing to push
+ (not a bug) bug: when quickly clicking the parent id link, it gets selected.
+ bug: when clicking parent id should scroll to the selected commit
+ linkify the parent ids and emails
+ revamped changes header view
+ revamped stage header view
+ command-up should jump through the history
+ should load picture from addressbook
+ should load picture from gravatar
+ bug: when editing an empty commit message and clicking on a row in tableview, the resizing happens before selection and the wrong row is selected.
+ bug: when commited by clicking a button while focused on tableview, textview did not send resignFirstResponder and did not resize itself.
+ bug: should resize commit header when window is resized
+ (ugly fix) bug: one-line merge commit message does not always show up (in commitviewcontroller)
+ should disable commit button when not applicable
+ should animate resizing
+ should display a cmd+return hint when hit return+delay
+ should display a history of your commits by cmd+up/down
+ bug: sidebar badge: 1000 -> 999+
+ todo: test that commented out self.branches = task.branches still makes remote branches to be updated after fetch
+ bug: when opening git.git repo, gitbox fetches, and fetches, and fetches...
  + something different (maybe multiple remotes) causes infinite update:
    two remotes are declared with different names, but with the same refspec to fetch. Thus, one of them is not shown in show-ref.
    Need to make double fetch if refspec is not default: first for the .git/config refspec, second for the 
  + always fetch with explicit refspec
  + bug: seems like invalid remote server yield infinite reloading
  + bug: seems like remote alias kernel.org is cut into "kernel"
  + bug: seems like tag from ls-remote "refs/tags/v1.7.0.2^{}" makes needsFetch
+ doing [OABlockGroup verify] in dealloc is a bad idea: should wrap with [OABlockGroup groupBlock:^{} continuation:^{}]
+ build local and remote branches out of git show-ref results, not from ls-remote.
+ bug in 1.0, 1.1: when non-remote branch is selected on the right
+ compare ls-remote with show-ref to know whether to fetch or not
+ if configured branch is not found in show-ref, then consider a new branch, get rid of isNewRemoteBranch flag.
+ bug: push/popFSEventsPause when fetching and other .git-modifying tasks
+ bug: when creating a new remote branch, GBHistoryTask fails to ignore it and fails on git level => empty commits list instead of green-pilled list
+ bug: when commit is checked out, the remote branch is reset (+ it reset on occasional branch updates)
+ bug: seems like after the push, branch update invokes fetch. Should update the pushed ref properly to avoid that.
+ feature: checkout a commit from local branch menu (prefilled with currently selected commit)

+ bug: branches with "/" in the name are processed incorrectly [Christian van der Leeden <christian.vanderleeden@googlemail.com>]
+ bug: branch association fails when branch name has a dot (like v1.5) [Falk Hoppe <falk.hoppe@innoq.com>]
  git config --get-regexp branch."v1.5".*
  (still needs ls-remotes fixes, see below)
+ do ls-remote origin in background to: refresh list of branches and find out if needs fetching; do not fetch regularly so not to block the ui
+ bug: fetch remote branches when added a remote server or a branch was pushed: otherwise, couldn't checkout remote branch and when selecting it, it's empty.
+ bug: when remote branch is pushed from elsewhere, ls-remote updates the list, but the branch is not fetched and when you try to check out this remote branch, checkout fails. The same issue leads to missing blue pills when you switch from another branch.
+ read ls-remotes when updated .git (makes sense when pushed a branch from the terminal)

+ nice screen for the commit: bigger line height, variable height message, no awful table header, segmented switch for sorting
+ gravatar image in the commit window
+ snap sidebar
+ do not resize sidebar when resizing a window
+ do not load stuff for the commit immediately while scrolling - have a delay
+ Better terminal handling http://www.wmdeveloper.com/2010/09/open-terminal-here.html

- reactions to macappstore: http://www.tuaw.com/2010/10/21/developer-reactions-to-the-mac-app-store/#continued


Ongoing tasks:

- human message in case git cannot merge/pull when some files are modified (error: Untracked working tree file 'Patryst.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj' would be overwritten by merge.)

- Secondary windows are opened in sheets (Preferences, Open Repository etc.)
- check for memory leaks
- check behavior when opendiff is missing
- check that opendiff is selected by default on new start + it is not selected if it is missing

Error messages translation to English:
- failed pull: need commit first: "error: Your local changes to 'TODO.txt' would be overwritten by merge.  Aborting. Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge. Updating c3c800f..87bc4f4"
- failed merge
- failed push (actually, should prevent from pushing when some commits are fetched)


Bugs:

- bug: push over https (Github now supports pushing by HTTPS)
- bug: when connecting over https (and maybe http), gitbox locks on password prompt.  [Nicolai Schulten <nicolai.schulten@byte-garden.de>]
- bug: git repo in dropbox causes gitbox to refresh frequently [Tom Martin <tom@devart.org>]
- bug: paypal payment option does not allow coupon? [Luis Martins <luis.martins@multiweb.pt>]
- when a long process modifies the working directory, the FSEvents wait till the very end, but should refresh each 2 seconds or so.
- maybe a bug: if the stage view is not selected, commit: action is not available
- preferences: should select "Other" when typing
- preferences: should focus text field when selected "Other"
- todo: think on the best and consistent way to terminate tasks
- delete a repo from the list by pressing backspace

- undo for ref checkout
- undo for branch reset
- conflict stage: highlight conflicted changes, allow to choose one of the versions 
- delete local branch
- delete remote branch
- force push a branch (when push fails, allow force push)
- bonjour publishing and cloning (see http://github.com/chad/gitjour; NSNetService)
- github integration: handling other repos/branches, pull requests and initial setup commands
- maybe: easy/hidden rebase to keep history clean? (actually, need a "rebase continue" and "cancel")
- find-as-you-type search in stage
- history: probably get rid of dates, and design it in a more cheesy fashion
- history: navigate to the sha1
- history: navigate back and forward (History main menu)
- history: reset a branch to a selected commit
- history: checkout a commit
- history: extract commit into new folder

- gitosis integration
- shell command to open gitbox

- stash/apply stash from the menu, context menu
- commit header: show parent ids using <a href="gitbox://git@sss.pierlis.com/repo.git#commits/sha1">...</a>
- handling URL schema: gitbox://git@sss.pierlis.com/repo.git#commits/sha1
- individual chunks commit
- diff viewer: file history, diff and blame in one window
- diff viewer: load blame info & history asynchronously
- diff viewer: switch to hide history
- diff viewer: button to go to a folder at this commit 
- changes view: 2 tabs: changes & tree (tree should show a status as usual)
- Option/Alt key lets to fetch instead of pull
- Shift key lets force push


Enhancements (works fine, but can be better):

- choose a custom name for a repo? or use an image?
- remember activity window visibility


Something to think about:

- svn support ('git svn clone', 'git svn rebase' and 'git svn dcommit')
- compare image files in an double-pane image viewer
- built-in diff view for better UTF8 support (FileMerge is stupid)
- mercurial support
- compare office files using some office app: cooperate with Kaleidoscope
- browse the server with SSH and select a repository
- allow switching to a system-provided git in preferences
- log: mark as read/unread + automatic mark as read
- csv support
- rerere - for recording how the conflict was resolved
- bisect is basically not needed if you can checkout any commit and see all the commits on the remote branch
- maintain selection of the commit when switching branches/tags etc.
