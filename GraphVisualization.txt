- Do not track branches, only parents.
- Do not draw connections and lines for common commits.
- Start drawing with the latest common commit, mark it in gray.
- Blue line can be merged with green line multiple times in any direction.
- One line will be drawn in case of fastforward (blue or green).
- Two lines if branches both have unique commits.
- Should also shift commit cells to the left/right to be more clear.
- We should choose more contrast pair of colors. Say, orange and blue. Also think about daltonism.
