.SH "NAME"
git-pull \- Fetch from and merge with another repository or a local branch
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fIgit pull\fR <options> <repository> <refspec>\&...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Runs \fIgit fetch\fR with the given parameters, and calls \fIgit merge\fR to merge the retrieved head(s) into the current branch\&. With \-\-rebase, calls \fIgit rebase\fR instead of \fIgit merge\fR\&.
.sp
Note that you can use \&. (current directory) as the <repository> to pull from the local repository \(em this is useful when merging local branches into the current branch\&.
.sp
Also note that options meant for \fIgit pull\fR itself and underlying \fIgit merge\fR must be given before the options meant for \fIgit fetch\fR\&.
.sp
\fBWarning\fR: Running \fIgit pull\fR (actually, the underlying \fIgit merge\fR) with uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it leaves you in a state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-q, \-\-quiet
.RS 4
This is passed to both underlying git\-fetch to squelch reporting of during transfer, and underlying git\-merge to squelch output during merging\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v, \-\-verbose
.RS 4
Pass \-\-verbose to git\-fetch and git\-merge\&.
.RE
.SS "Options related to merging"
.PP
\-\-commit, \-\-no\-commit
.RS 4
Perform the merge and commit the result\&. This option can be used to override \-\-no\-commit\&.
.sp
With \-\-no\-commit perform the merge but pretend the merge failed and do not autocommit, to give the user a chance to inspect and further tweak the merge result before committing\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ff, \-\-no\-ff
.RS 4
Do not generate a merge commit if the merge resolved as a fast\-forward, only update the branch pointer\&. This is the default behavior of git\-merge\&.
.sp
With \-\-no\-ff Generate a merge commit even if the merge resolved as a fast\-forward\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-log, \-\-no\-log
.RS 4
In addition to branch names, populate the log message with one\-line descriptions from the actual commits that are being merged\&.
.sp
With \-\-no\-log do not list one\-line descriptions from the actual commits being merged\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stat, \-n, \-\-no\-stat
.RS 4
Show a diffstat at the end of the merge\&. The diffstat is also controlled by the configuration option merge\&.stat\&.
.sp
With \-n or \-\-no\-stat do not show a diffstat at the end of the merge\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-squash, \-\-no\-squash
.RS 4
Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually make a commit or move the
HEAD, nor record
$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD
to cause the next
git commit
command to create a merge commit\&. This allows you to create a single commit on top of the current branch whose effect is the same as merging another branch (or more in case of an octopus)\&.
.sp
With \-\-no\-squash perform the merge and commit the result\&. This option can be used to override \-\-squash\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ff\-only
.RS 4
Refuse to merge and exit with a non\-zero status unless the current
HEAD
is already up\-to\-date or the merge can be resolved as a fast\-forward\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s <strategy>, \-\-strategy=<strategy>
.RS 4
Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than once to specify them in the order they should be tried\&. If there is no
\-s
option, a built\-in list of strategies is used instead (\fIgit merge\-recursive\fR
when merging a single head,
\fIgit merge\-octopus\fR
otherwise)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-X <option>, \-\-strategy\-option=<option>
.RS 4
Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge strategy\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-summary, \-\-no\-summary
.RS 4
Synonyms to \-\-stat and \-\-no\-stat; these are deprecated and will be removed in the future\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q, \-\-quiet
.RS 4
Operate quietly\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v, \-\-verbose
.RS 4
Be verbose\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-rebase
.RS 4
Instead of a merge, perform a rebase after fetching\&. If there is a remote ref for the upstream branch, and this branch was rebased since last fetched, the rebase uses that information to avoid rebasing non\-local changes\&. To make this the default for branch
<name>, set configuration
branch\&.<name>\&.rebase
to
true\&.

\-\-no\-tags
.RS 4
By default, tags that point at objects that are downloaded from the remote repository are fetched and stored locally\&. This option disables this automatic tag following\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t, \-\-tags
.RS 4
Most of the tags are fetched automatically as branch heads are downloaded, but tags that do not point at objects reachable from the branch heads that are being tracked will not be fetched by this mechanism\&. This flag lets all tags and their associated objects be downloaded\&.
.RE
.PP
\-u, \-\-update\-head\-ok

By default
\fIgit fetch\fR
refuses to update the head which corresponds to the current branch\&. This flag disables the check\&. This is purely for the internal use for
\fIgit pull\fR
to communicate with
\fIgit fetch\fR, and unless you are implementing your own Porcelain you are not supposed to use it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-upload\-pack <upload\-pack>
.RS 4
When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled by

\fI\-\-exec=<upload\-pack>\fR
is passed to the command to specify non\-default path for the command run on the other end\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-progress

:, followed by the destination ref <dst>\&.
.sp
The remote ref that matches <src> is fetched, and if <dst> is not empty string, the local ref that matches it is fast\-forwarded using <src>\&. If the optional plus

If the remote branch from which you want to pull is modified in non\-linear ways such as being rewound and rebased frequently, then a pull will attempt a merge with an older version of itself, likely conflict, and fail\&. It is under these conditions that you would want to use the
+
sign to indicate non\-fast\-forward updates will be needed\&. There is currently no easy way to determine or declare that a branch will be made available in a repository with this behavior; the pulling user simply must know this is the expected usage pattern for a branch\&.

You never do your own development on branches that appear on the right hand side of a <refspec> colon on

B, have a
Pull:
line to track it (i\&.e\&.
Pull: B:remote\-B), and have a separate branch
my\-B
to do your development on top of it\&. The latter is created by
git branch my\-B remote\-B
(or its equivalent
git checkout \-b my\-B remote\-B)\&. Run
git fetch
to keep track of the progress of the remote side, and when you see something new on the remote branch, merge it into your development branch with

There is a difference between listing multiple <refspec> directly on
\fIgit pull\fR
command line and having multiple
Pull:
<refspec> lines for a <repository> and running
\fIgit pull\fR
command without any explicit <refspec> parameters\&. <refspec> listed explicitly on the command line are always merged into the current branch after fetching\&. In other words, if you list more than one remote refs, you would be making an Octopus\&. While
\fIgit pull\fR
run without any explicit <refspec> parameter takes default <refspec>s from
Pull:
lines, it merges only the first <refspec> found into the current branch, after fetching all the remote refs\&. This is because making an Octopus from remote refs is rarely done, while keeping track of multiple remote heads in one\-go by fetching more than one is often useful\&.

where <address> may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary URL\-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being invoked\&. See \fBgit-remote-helpers\fR(1) for details\&.
.sp
If there are a large number of similarly\-named remote repositories and you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration section of the form:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        [url "<actual url base>"]
                insteadOf = <other url base>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
For example, with this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        [url "git://git\&.host\&.xz/"]
                insteadOf = host\&.xz:/path/to/
                insteadOf = work:
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
a URL like "work:repo\&.git" or like "host\&.xz:/path/to/repo\&.git" will be rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be "git://git\&.host\&.xz/repo\&.git"\&.
.sp
If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a configuration section of the form:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        [url "<actual url base>"]
                pushInsteadOf = <other url base>
.fi
.if n \{\

                pushInsteadOf = git://example\&.org/
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
a URL like "git://example\&.org/path/to/repo\&.git" will be rewritten to "ssh://example\&.org/path/to/repo\&.git" for pushes, but pulls will still use the original URL\&.
.SH "REMOTES"
.sp

.PP
resolve

.RE
.PP
recursive
.RS 4
This can only resolve two heads using a 3\-way merge algorithm\&. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for 3\-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the 3\-way merge\&. This has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mis\-merges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2\&.6 kernel development history\&. Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving renames\&. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch\&.

The

This should not be confused with the

octopus
.RS 4

ours
.RS 4
This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively ignoring all changes from all other branches\&.

.RE
.PP
subtree
.RS 4
This is a modified recursive strategy\&. When merging trees A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level\&. This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree\&.

.SH "DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR"

Often people use git pull without giving any parameter\&. Traditionally, this has been equivalent to saying git pull origin\&. However, when configuration branch\&.<name>\&.remote is present while on branch <name>, that value is used instead of origin\&.
.sp
In order to determine what URL to use to fetch from, the value of the configuration remote\&.<origin>\&.url is consulted and if there is not any such variable, the value on URL: line in $GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin> file is used\&.

In order to determine what remote branches to fetch (and optionally store in the tracking branches) when the command is run without any refspec parameters on the command line, values of the configuration variable remote\&.<origin>\&.fetch are consulted, and if there aren\(aqt any, $GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin> file is consulted and its Pull: lines are used\&.

A globbing refspec must have a non\-empty RHS (i\&.e\&. must store what were fetched in tracking branches), and its LHS and RHS must end with /*\&. The above specifies that all remote branches are tracked using tracking branches in refs/remotes/origin/ hierarchy under the same name\&.
.sp
The rule to determine which remote branch to merge after fetching is a bit involved, in order not to break backward compatibility\&.
.sp
If explicit refspecs were given on the command line of git pull, they are all merged\&.
.sp
When no refspec was given on the command line, then git pull uses the refspec from the configuration or $GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin>\&. In such cases, the following rules apply:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
If
branch\&.<name>\&.merge
configuration for the current branch
<name>
exists, that is the name of the branch at the remote site that is merged\&.

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
If the refspec is a globbing one, nothing is merged\&.

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  3." 4.2
.\}
Otherwise the remote branch of the first refspec is merged\&.

Update the remote\-tracking branches for the repository you cloned from, then merge one of them into your current branch:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git pull, git pull origin
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Normally the branch merged in is the HEAD of the remote repository, but the choice is determined by the branch\&.<name>\&.remote and branch\&.<name>\&.merge options; see
\fBgit-config\fR(1)
for details\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Merge into the current branch the remote branch
next:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git pull origin next
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This leaves a copy of
next
temporarily in FETCH_HEAD, but does not update any remote\-tracking branches\&. Using remote\-tracking branches, the same can be done by invoking fetch and merge:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git fetch origin
$ git merge origin/next
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}

If you tried a pull which resulted in a complex conflicts and would want to start over, you can recover with \fIgit reset\fR\&.
