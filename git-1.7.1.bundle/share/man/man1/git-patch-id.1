.SH "NAME"
git-patch-id \- Compute unique ID for a patch
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fIgit patch\-id\fR < <patch>
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
A "patch ID" is nothing but a SHA1 of the diff associated with a patch, with whitespace and line numbers ignored\&. As such, it\(aqs "reasonably stable", but at the same time also reasonably unique, i\&.e\&., two patches that have the same "patch ID" are almost guaranteed to be the same thing\&.
.sp
IOW, you can use this thing to look for likely duplicate commits\&.
.sp
When dealing with \fIgit diff\-tree\fR output, it takes advantage of the fact that the patch is prefixed with the object name of the commit, and outputs two 40\-byte hexadecimal strings\&. The first string is the patch ID, and the second string is the commit ID\&. This can be used to make a mapping from patch ID to commit ID\&.
