.SH "NAME"
git-cherry-pick \- Apply the change introduced by an existing commit
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fIgit cherry\-pick\fR [\-\-edit] [\-n] [\-m parent\-number] [\-s] [\-x] [\-\-ff] <commit>
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Given one existing commit, apply the change the patch introduces, and record a new commit that records it\&. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
<commit>
.RS 4
Commit to cherry\-pick\&. For a more complete list of ways to spell commits, see the "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in
\fBgit-rev-parse\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-e, \-\-edit
.RS 4
With this option,
\fIgit cherry\-pick\fR
will let you edit the commit message prior to committing\&.
.RE
.PP
\-x
.RS 4
When recording the commit, append to the original commit message a note that indicates which commit this change was cherry\-picked from\&. Append the note only for cherry picks without conflicts\&. Do not use this option if you are cherry\-picking from your private branch because the information is useless to the recipient\&. If on the other hand you are cherry\-picking between two publicly visible branches (e\&.g\&. backporting a fix to a maintenance branch for an older release from a development branch), adding this information can be useful\&.
.RE
.PP
\-r
.RS 4
It used to be that the command defaulted to do
\-x
described above, and
\-r
was to disable it\&. Now the default is not to do
\-x
so this option is a no\-op\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m parent\-number, \-\-mainline parent\-number
.RS 4
Usually you cannot cherry\-pick a merge because you do not know which side of the merge should be considered the mainline\&. This option specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of the mainline and allows cherry\-pick to replay the change relative to the specified parent\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n, \-\-no\-commit
.RS 4
Usually the command automatically creates a commit\&. This flag applies the change necessary to cherry\-pick the named commit to your working tree and the index, but does not make the commit\&. In addition, when this option is used, your index does not have to match the HEAD commit\&. The cherry\-pick is done against the beginning state of your index\&.
.sp
This is useful when cherry\-picking more than one commits\(aq effect to your index in a row\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s, \-\-signoff
.RS 4
Add Signed\-off\-by line at the end of the commit message\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ff
.RS 4
If the current HEAD is the same as the parent of the cherry\-pick\(aqed commit, then a fast forward to this commit will be performed\&.
