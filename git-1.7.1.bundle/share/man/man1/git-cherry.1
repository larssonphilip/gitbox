.SH "NAME"
git-cherry \- Find commits not merged upstream
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fIgit cherry\fR [\-v] [<upstream> [<head> [<limit>]]]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The changeset (or "diff") of each commit between the fork\-point and <head> is compared against each commit between the fork\-point and <upstream>\&. The commits are compared with their \fIpatch id\fR, obtained from the \fIgit patch\-id\fR program\&.
.sp
Every commit that doesn\(aqt exist in the <upstream> branch has its id (sha1) reported, prefixed by a symbol\&. The ones that have equivalent change already in the <upstream> branch are prefixed with a minus (\-) sign, and those that only exist in the <head> branch are prefixed with a plus (+) symbol:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
           __*__*__*__*__> <upstream>
          /
fork\-point
          \e__+__+__\-__+__+__\-__+__> <head>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If a <limit> has been given then the commits along the <head> branch up to and including <limit> are not reported:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
           __*__*__*__*__> <upstream>
          /
fork\-point
          \e__*__*__<limit>__\-__+__> <head>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Because \fIgit cherry\fR compares the changeset rather than the commit id (sha1), you can use \fIgit cherry\fR to find out if a commit you made locally has been applied <upstream> under a different commit id\&. For example, this will happen if you\(aqre feeding patches <upstream> via email rather than pushing or pulling commits directly\&.
