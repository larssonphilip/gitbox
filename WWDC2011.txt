Questions for WWDC 2011:

1. Looks like when the flag is missing kFSEventStreamCreateFlagNoDefer, stream still does not defer events?
2. Why Xcode4 sometimes consumes 100-200% CPU on Macbook Air?
3. FSEvents: how to design in such a way so no to miss events and support sequential updates?
4. [NSApp postEvent:] as a workaround for retained pipes/fds after [NSTask waitUntilExit] in the secondary thread.
5. AppleScript interaction (send data, get data)
6. LLDB fucks up output from NSTasks.
7.
