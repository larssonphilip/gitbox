Local repositories are organized in nested groups and displayed in the sidebar.

GBRepositoriesController has a list of id<GBSidebarLocalItem> objects,
which are GBRepositoryController or GBRepositoriesGroup objects.



Legacy format before 1.2:

- GBRepositoriesController has an array of GBBaseRepositoryController instances.
- GBAppDelegate stores and loads the list of URLs for these repos + URL for selected repo.
